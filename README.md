- Resources :
            Data source : election_results.txt
            Software : Python 3.10.4, 
                      Visual Studio Code editor 1.66.0

## 2. Results: 
  
<p align="justify"> After Refactoring-code, It is possible to execute large data and no longer time will take to get result. It has expand the limitation. It is capable to include the entire stock market over the last few years. it will work as well for thousands of stocks. <p>
  
  <p align="justify"> Arrys are created to make the project success :<p>
  
  ```ruby
    Dim tickervolumes(11) As Long
    Dim tickerStartingPrice(11) As Single
    Dim tickerEndingPrice(11) As Single
```

## 3. Summary:
  <p align="justify">Though programmers and software developers refactor the code to improve the design, structure and implementation of software, besides advantages, it has disadvantages also.<p>
  
###   Advantages:
  - Almost all codes are available, no need to expedite whole thing.
  - Codes are well organized.
  - Helps to follow sequence. 
  - It helps to find bugs
  - Time saving



### Disadvantages:
  
  - Though the code is pre-defined, no scope to experiment how to start coding from the beginning.
  - It is not possible to know if there any bugs on it.
